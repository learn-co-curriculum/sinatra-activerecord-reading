# Sinatra and Active Record CRUD

## Objectives

1. Understand how to implement the basic CRUD actions using Sinatra. 
2. Understand which controller actions render which views in implementing CRUD in Sinatra. 

## Introduction

We're familiar with how to preform the basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) actions using Active Record. Let's take a moment and review. For this example, we'll use the class name `Model` to stand in for whatever model your app is working with (`Post`, `Student`, `Song`, you name it). 

* Create: `Model.create`
* Read: `Model.all`/`Model.find(id_number)`
* Update: `Model.update`
* Delete: `Model.destroy`

Now, let's take a look at how to build out a Sinatra app that allows a user to implement these actions through the interface of the web. The details of what code gets written in each controller action are left slightly vague––you're going to need to do some careful thinking for yourself when it comes to building this out later on. The purpose of this reading is to illustrate the connections between the various controller actions and views needed to implement CRUD. 

## Connecting Controller Actions to Views for Implementing CRUD

### Create

The "create" part of CRUD is implemented in Sinatra by building a route, or controller action, to render the form for creating a new instance of your model. 

* The `get '/model/new'` route renders the view page with that form. 
* The `new.erb` is the view page that contains that form. 
* That form sends a `POST` request to another controller action, `post '/models'`. It is here that you place the code that extracts the form data from the `params` and uses it to create a new instance of your model class. Something along the lines of `Model.create(some_attribute: params[:some_attribute])`. 

### Read

There are two ways in which we can read data. We may want to "read" or deliver to our user, *all* of the instances of a class, or a *specific* instance of a class. 

* The `get '/models'` controller action handles requests for *all* instances of a class. It should load up all of those instances and set them equal to an instance variable: `@models = Model.all`. Then, it renders the `index.erb` view page. 
* The `index.erb` view page will use erb to render all of the instances stored in the `@models` instance variable. 
* The `get '/models/:id'` controller action handles requests for a given instance of your model. For example, if a user types in `www.yourwebsite.com/models/2`, this route will catch that request and get the `id` number, in this case `2`, from the params. It will then find the instance of the model with that id number and set it equal to an instance variable: `@model = Model.find(params[:id])`. Lastly, it will render the `show.erb` view page. 
* The `show.erb` view page will use erb to render the `@model` object. 

### Update

To implement the update action, we need a controller action that renders an update form and we need a controller action to catch the post request sent by that form. 

* The `get 'models/:id/edit'` controller action will render the `edit.erb` view page. 
* The `edit.erb` view page will contain the form for editing a given instance of a model. This form will send a `PATCH` request to `patch '/models/:id'`. 
* The `patch '/models/:id'` controller action will find the instance of the model to update, using the `id` from `params`, update and save that instance. 

We'll need to update `config.ru` to use the Sinatra Middleware that lets our app send `patch` requests.

config.ru:
```
use Rack::MethodOverride
run ApplicationController
```

From there, you'll need to add a line to your form:

edit.erb:
```html
<form action="<%=@model.id%>" method="post">
    <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="patch">
    <input type="text" ...>
</form>
```
The `MethodOverride` middleware will intercept every request sent and received by our application. If it finds a request with `name="_method"`, it will set the request type based on what is set in the `value` attribute. In this case `patch`.

### Delete

The delete part of CRUD is a little tricky. It doesn't get its own view page, but instead is implemented via a "delete button" on the show page of a given instance. This "delete button", however, isn't really a button, it's a form! The form should send a `DELETE` request to `delete '/models/:id/delete` and should contain only a "submit" button with a value of "delete". That way, it will appear as only a button to the user. Here's an example:

```html
<form method="post" action="/models/<%=@model.id%>/delete">
  <input id="hidden" type="hidden" name="_method" value="DELETE">
  <input type="submit" value="delete">
<form>
```

The hidden input field is important to note here. This is how you can submit PATCH and DELETE requests via Sinatra. The form tag `method` attribute will be set to `post`, but the hidden input field sets it to `DELETE`.


### Conclusion

Remember, the purpose of this reading is to help you understand which controller actions render which views, and which views have forms that send requests to which controller actions, as we implement CRUD. Check out the diagram below for the big picture:
